# ComputerVision
using python libraries like cv2, pandas, numpy, bokeh this project will capture live videos through webcam ( or any other source user selects ) and will not down the capture the time that the the motion capture is triggered. by comparing the first frame this code can identify if there are any disturbances and draw a square around the object.

**Test Runs**

3.After the program ends, a detailed analysis of the time and movement chart will be presented to the user.
